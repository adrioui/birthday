# Execution vs Planning

Understanding the distinction between planning work and executing work.

## Planning Phase

- Research and understand the problem
- Explore codebase patterns
- Create implementation plan
- Identify dependencies and blockers

## Execution Phase

- Implement the planned solution
- Write code following project conventions
- Test and verify implementation
- Commit and push changes

## When to Use Each

Use **planning** when:

- You need to understand how a system works
- You're exploring multiple approaches
- You need to research best practices

Use **execution** when:

- You have a clear task definition
- You know the implementation approach
- You need to get work done

## Beads Workflow

- **Planning**: Create issues, break down tasks, identify dependencies
- **Execution**: Work on issues, close them when complete
