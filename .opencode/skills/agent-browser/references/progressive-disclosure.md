# Progressive Disclosure

An approach to reading documentation that reveals information incrementally.

## Principle

Don't read all documentation upfront. Read what's relevant to the current task.

## How to Apply

1. **Start**: Read high-level overview
2. **Identify**: What do you need to accomplish?
3. **Target**: Read only relevant sections
4. **Iterate**: Return to docs as needed

## Benefits

- Reduces cognitive load
- Focuses attention on relevant information
- Faster onboarding to new codebases
- Better retention of key concepts

## Example

**Instead of**: Reading all of `AGENTS.md` before starting

**Do**:

1. Skim overview
2. Jump to relevant sections (e.g., "Testing" if you need to write tests)
3. Reference other sections as needed

## In Practice

When starting a task:

1. Read the high-level project description
2. Identify which concepts relate to your task
3. Read specific documentation for those concepts
4. Ask for clarification if needed
