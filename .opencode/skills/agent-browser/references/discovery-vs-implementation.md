# Discovery vs Implementation

Understanding the distinction between discovering patterns and implementing features.

## Discovery Phase

**Goal**: Understand existing code patterns and conventions

**Activities**:

- Explore codebase structure
- Search for similar implementations
- Read documentation and comments
- Identify patterns and anti-patterns

**Output**:

- Understanding of conventions
- List of relevant files
- Implementation approach notes

## Implementation Phase

**Goal**: Build or modify features following discovered patterns

**Activities**:

- Write code following conventions
- Use identified patterns
- Test the implementation
- Document changes

**Output**:

- Working feature or fix
- Test coverage
- Commit message

## When to Switch

Switch from discovery to implementation when:

- You have a clear understanding of the approach
- You know which files to modify
- You've identified relevant patterns to follow

Switch from implementation to discovery when:

- You encounter unfamiliar code
- You need to understand existing patterns
- You're unsure about conventions
