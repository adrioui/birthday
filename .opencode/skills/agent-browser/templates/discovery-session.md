# Discovery Session Template

Starting a discovery session to explore codebase patterns.

## Objective

[What are you trying to discover?]

## Approach

1. Use codebase exploration tools (grep, glob, read)
2. Focus on relevant components and patterns
3. Document findings for implementation phase

## Key Questions to Answer

- [ ] Question 1
- [ ] Question 2
- [ ] Question 3

## Progress Tracker

- Explored: [files examined]
- Identified: [patterns found]
- Documented: [notes location]

## Notes

[Record discoveries and patterns here]

## Handoff

When discovery is complete, create a handoff note for implementation phase.
